# Apex Training Solutions
Final Project for ITEC291

For this project, I was tasked to design a website for a safety training company, which I named 'Apex Training Solutions'. This project is purely front-end, so there's no database storing any information entered in the forms, nor is there any server-side or client-side validation when entering form data. 

For this design, I took inspiration from OSHAcademy's website and got assistance from W3Schools for the trickier code. It takes a sleek, modern, and minimalistic approach. I kept the colour scheme simple, using 3 different shades of blue, white, and black values. Each page kept a consistent design, ensuring easy navigation, with links to the different pages on both the navigation bar and the footer. All the forms carry the same design, with one slight change for the enrollment form which included a background image.

When the user enters the website, they are greeted by the hero section, where the company's tagline is displayed. As they scroll, they will be greeted by the 'About' section, then the 'Services' section, then 'Courses', then 'Testimonials', which displays reviews from clients about the company.
